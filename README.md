## Cargo tracking with Clean DDD

The idea behind this project is to build something similar to [DDDSample](https://github.com/citerus/dddsample-core).
But using slightly different approach. I'll try to use ideas and principles behind:

- Hexagonal architecture
- Clean architecture
- Use case driven development

Here
is [an article on Medium](https://medium.com/@gushakov/revisiting-cargo-tracking-application-using-clean-ddd-4ed16c0e6ae1)
which will comment on the interesting points and decisions behind this implementation.

### Copyright notice

This application is based heavily on the original [DDDSample](https://github.com/citerus/dddsample-core) application
by [Citerus AB](http://www.citerus.se/) and [Domain Language](https://www.domainlanguage.com/).

The original work is distributed under the MIT licence. I've included [the original licence](./original-license.txt)
with
this project.

Wherever possible, I'll try to mention the original code which was consulted for any specific implementation point.

### How to run

This application is a standard Spring Boot application. There is also a Docker compose file with a Postgres database,
which should be started prior to the execution of the application. You may need to start the database for some
integration tests as well.

### Exploring DDDSample DB

To be able to explore the relational model used by DDDSample, we can add an embedded web server to the original
application.
There is an example configuration available here: [HsqlDbServerConfig.java](./etc/db/HsqlDbServerConfig.java).

To launch the server, you need `hsqldb-2.4.0.jar` (available from Maven central):

on Unix

> java -cp ~/.m2/repository/org/hsqldb/hsqldb/2.4.0/hsqldb-2.4.0.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManagerSwing

or on Windows

> java -cp %HOME%/.m2/repository/org/hsqldb/hsqldb/2.4.0/hsqldb-2.4.0.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManagerSwing

This should start the UI of the DB viewer. The type of connection to use is "HSQL Database Engine WebServer" and JDBC
URL to use is `jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/dddsample`.
